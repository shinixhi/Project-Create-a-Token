This Solidity smart contract implements a basic token named "Shinixhi" with the abbreviation "Shin". The contract includes functionalities for minting and burning tokens, and maintains a record of each address's token balance.

Features
Public Variables:

tokenName: Stores the name of the token, "Shinixhi".
tokenAbbrv: Stores the abbreviation of the token, "Shin".
totalSupply: Keeps track of the total supply of the tokens.
Mappings:

balances: A mapping from addresses to their respective token balances.
Functions:

mint: This function increases the total supply of tokens and the balance of a specified address.
burn: This function decreases the total supply of tokens and the balance of a specified address, with a check to ensure the address has enough tokens to burn.

    // public variables here

    function mint(address _address, uint _value) public {
        totalSupply += _value;
        balances[_address] += _value;

    // burn function
    function burn(address _address, uint _value) public {

            balances[_address] -= _value;

    }
}

Detailed Explanation
Public Variables
tokenName: This is a string that holds the name of the token. In this contract, the token name is "Shinixhi".
tokenAbbrv: This is a string that holds the abbreviated form of the token name. In this contract, the abbreviation is "Shin".
totalSupply: This is an unsigned integer that keeps track of the total supply of tokens in circulation.
Mappings
balances: This mapping associates each address with its respective token balance. The key is an address, and the value is the balance of tokens held by that address.
Functions
mint:

Parameters: An address (_address) and a value (_value).
Functionality: Increases the totalSupply of tokens by the specified value and adds the same amount to the balance of the specified address.
Example: If mint(0xABC, 100) is called, 100 tokens are added to the total supply and the balance of the address 0xABC.
burn:

Parameters: An address (_address) and a value (_value).
Functionality: Decreases the totalSupply of tokens by the specified value and subtracts the same amount from the balance of the specified address, provided the address has enough tokens.
Condition: The function checks if the address has a balance greater than or equal to the value to be burned. If not, the function does nothing.
Example: If burn(0xABC, 50) is called and the address 0xABC has at least 50 tokens, 50 tokens are subtracted from the total supply and the balance of 0xABC.
This contract is a simple example of how to create, mint, and burn tokens using Solidity, ensuring the correct maintenance of the total supply and individual balances.
